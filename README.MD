An application for coaches to manage their account and reservations

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
*  Android Studio with an emulator
*  Node
*  Npm
*  SQL

### Installing
! important: import the database dump file for both applications to function!

Native Mobile app
*  Open build.grade in android studio and build the project
*  Run the app with any emulator
*  Run the Node app to get started

Node.js app
*  Open any terminal and navigate to the project folder
*  Run 'npm i'
*  Run 'run nodemon app.js'
*  Run the NMA to see the the app running

In response to the comments.md file I have removed the users route and controller as these are not used.
However the seperation in files have remained, the application has been build with a laravel/.net background,
therefore routes and controllers are seperated and controllers reply with responses.

## Built with
*  Android Studio with Java
*  Node.js
